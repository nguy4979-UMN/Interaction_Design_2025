        <h1>Changing the World a Sheet at a Time</h1>
        <h2>After our founder, James Toilette, realized that there is a deficit in the market of quality, novel toilet paper in the market, he knew what he had to do. He bought a warehouse, stole some machinery, and obliterated his uncleâ€™s 25 acre land. In just two days after the first batch finished, he was able to pay them back and his bail.
            <br> <br> Good quality toilet paper should never be compromised. We at ToiletTrees believe that every roll should be created with care, except Fresh From The Tree. That was processed by beavers alone. We strive to make every product count and be used with comfort until the last piece. Never give up on your standards, we wil never give up on you <3</h2>
